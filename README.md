# project_setup

The purpose of this project is have some tutorials helping me (or any other developers) set up a SaaS project from scratch. 

It will cover different steps, from setting up the AWS environment to building a CICD pipeline using Github. The tutorials can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/rfrad/project_setup/wiki/Home) section.
