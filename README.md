# tutorials

The purpose of this project is to have some tutorials helping me (or any other developers) set up any type of projects from scratch. 

It will cover different steps, from setting up the AWS environment to building CICD pipelines. The tutorials can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/rfrad/tutorials/wiki/Home) section.
